        Context:
        An attacker may create Azure DevOps Agent Pools for malicious activity that are separate from an organizationâ€™s pools.

        Detection:
        This detection monitors for the creation and deletion of Agent Pools within 5 days by the same user, with the intent of finding Agent Pools active for short durations.

        Recommended Actions:
        If an alert occurs, investigate the actions taken by the account to determine if this is normal operation of deleting pools or if this suspicious activity.

        Tuning Recommendations:
        If necessary, add a tuning expression for users who frequently create and delete agent pools within the time period specified.
        If necessary, adjust the "within" time period to better represent what is considered a short time period in your organization. Note that 5 days is the maximum time period you can specify for a chain rules.

        Credits:
        This rule is loosely based on the Azure Sentinel ADOAgentPoolCreatedDeleted.yaml detection.

        Tuning Recommendations:
        Determine if the baseline basis should be hourly or daily based on normal activity in your organization.
        If the detection is proving to be too sensitive to the number of pools deleted, adjust the floor value (currently 3) to a number that is less sensitive but within reason. Use Sumo Search using a count and the _timeslice function to aggregate on the number of pools deleted within the hourly (or daily) periods to find what is an acceptable level of activity to not alert on.
